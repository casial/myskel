Various "skeleton" and rc files - mainly for linux and bash.
The intended purpose is to speed-up customizing fresh linux 
distros installs and/or new/rolled-back remote servers or VPS.

GitHub could be an ideal platform for this, as well as for 
getting-to-know with GitHub itself. 

I am going to merge two sources for this repo - my current 'skel' 
source at https://velemlok.cz/skel/ and a similar project by Sam Rowe
 - https://github.com/riddley/bashfiles (Sam used to have great blog
at http://samrowe.com/wordpress/ - although not updated anymore, it 
is still a great source for learning a thing or two about Bash).
